### How to use SSL secured WebUI

In order to have a SSL secured access to your node's WebUI, place here the following files:
* ca.crt
* server.key
* server.crt

If all the three files are in place, SSL server will be started at port 4433, in parallell to the regular HTTP server.

The SSL server will accept connections from any IP address, regardless of the WebUI setting in `gocoin.conf` file.

In order to access it you will need `client.p12` certificate imported into your browser's Personal certificates.

Then use URL like **https://your.hostname.or.ip:4433/**


### Generate ca.key and ca.crt
> openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096
> openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

Import `ca.crt` into your browser's Trusted Root CA list and place its copy in the current folder.

### Create v3.ext file
Create file named `v3.ext` with the following content:

	authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
	basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
	keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
	subjectAltName = @alt_names

	[alt_names]
	DNS.1 = domain.com

Replace **domain.com** with your node's hostname or IP.

### Generate server.key and server.crt
	openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
	openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

When asked for **Common Name** give your node's hostname or IP (same value as **DNS.1** in `v3.ext` file)

	openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt -sha256 -extfile v3.ext

When finished, place `server.key` and `server.crt` in the current folder.

### Generate client.p12
	openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
	openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr
	openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out client.crt
	openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in client.crt -inkey client.key -out client.p12

Import `client.p12` into your browser's Personal certificates.


### Security pracautions

In order to assure the security of the WebUI, make sure to keep the `ca.key` and all the `client.*` files secret.
Whoever gets access to any of these files, will be able to access your node's WebUI.
