<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
If you want to run the full node (<b>client</b>), your system ought to have <u>at least 16GB of RAM</u>.<br>
It is possible to run it will less memory (e.g. 8GB), but it will likely affect performance and might even
make the software to crash sometimes.<br>
To run the <b>client</b> also need 64-bit OS and a file system that support files larger than 4GB (e.g NTFS or ext2/ext3/ext4).<br>
<br>
If you only want to use the <b>wallet</b> with the corresponding <b>balio</b> tool, you don't have to worry about
the system memory or a file system.
