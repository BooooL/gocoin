<h1>Known issues</h1>

<h2>Coinbase maturity</h2>
According to the block chain protocol, generated coins can be spent only after 100 confirmations.<br>
Users should be aware that fetching a wallet's balance from the client returns&nbsp;also&nbsp;immature coinbase transactions.<br>
If you provide such coins to the gocoin wallet, the network will not mine your signed transaction until the coinbase
inputs that you included in get 100 confirmations.<br>
<br>
<h2>Mining API</h2>
The mining RPC API is experimental and had been implemented in March 2016 - far before the segwit support was added.<br>
It was tested on Testnet3 and worked well, but only for one mining setup. It has not been used ever since then.<br>
If you are interested in using Gocoin node for mining, please contact me (tonikt@assets-otc.com) so I can help you with any issues that may need resolving these days.<br>
